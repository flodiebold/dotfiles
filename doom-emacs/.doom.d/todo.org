#+TITLE: DOOM Emacs TODO
* TODO workman keybindings
* DONE solarized
* TODO better org display
* TODO fix search
* TODO keybindings & stuff
** M-x to SPC SPC?
** TODO SPC v?
** TODO evil-cleverparens
** TODO completion on TAB?
** surround: S (and dS or cS)
** error navigation?
* rust setup
** trigger completion
-> seems to be bug? evaluating lsp-completion--looking-back-trigger-characterp seems to have fixed it
** doc popup
-> disabled by lsp module; instead use K to display docs
would need to enable lsp-ui-doc-enable, plus set back lsp-ui-doc-max-height/width to reasonable values
** better keybindings for code actions
** semantic highlighting
*** TODO make mutable work
*** TODO add other token types
*** TODO make the theme nicer
- don't use blue/orange for everything?
- maybe don't give keywords that weird green either
* Good stuff / keybindings
** Search: SPC s d
** Buffer search: SPC s s
** Evil exchange: g x
** Window management:

** Bookmarks: SPC RET
** comment line -> g c c
